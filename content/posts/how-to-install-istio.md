In this post we are going to process to install Istio with Kiali but firstly we need to define everything, because sometime we are setting stuff without thinking and that - as I could see in a lot of business - is not a good thing. So... let's go to see what it is all about Istio.

## What is Istio?
Istio is a “Service Mesh”. That’s what everyone is saying but What the hell is service mesh? Because if you never heard about Kubernetes in your degree as a IT Engineer the most similar thing that you’re going to think is about that scary thing which is Mesh networking. Well I have to say Sorry, it’s something similar and I say sorry because a lot of people who I know when they listen that they run out because it was one section of a really scary subject in the degree. Anyway, Service Mesh is an additional layer of software that we deploy alongside our cluster. It's really easy isn't it?
