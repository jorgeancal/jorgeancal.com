      <description>To whom it may concern,
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to change my way in my career&amp;hellip; Two months ago I started to work as an SRE. Yep SRE. I&amp;rsquo;ve paused my Java Developer career to be an SRE, these are the reasons why I did that.
I think I have to explain one thing&amp;hellip; I started working at Crunch 11 months ago. This was my first job in the UK and believe me my English was awful, I thought I knew how to speak and how to explain things&amp;hellip; until I started to work&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m really glad I had a senior with a lot of patience with me when I was trying to explain myself.</description>
